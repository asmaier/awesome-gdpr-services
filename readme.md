<!-- description -->

This is a curated list of GDPR compliant services (and software tools) probably mostly useful for companies and people based in the EU.

</div>

A GDPR compliant service can only be delivered by a company based in a country that has implemented the GDPR or has a similar law (see the red and blue countries on the following map)

- https://www.gdpradvisor.co.uk/gdpr-countries

Most notably this excludes any (cloud) services offered by companies based in the USA. This is caused by the incompatibility of US law with the GDPR, see also
