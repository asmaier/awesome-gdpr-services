<!-- description -->

This is a curated list of GDPR compliant services (and software tools) probably mostly useful for companies and people based in the EU.

</div>

A GDPR compliant service can only be delivered by a company based in a country that has implemented the GDPR or has a similar law (see the red and blue countries on the following map)

Most notably this excludes any (cloud) services offered by companies based in the USA. This is caused by the incompatibility of US law with the GDPR, see also
